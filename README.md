# Welcome to Py2Jul!
Py2Jul is a source-to-source compiler converting *procedural* Python source code
into corresponding Julia source code. As its most basic functionality, Py2Jul parses
a Python input file and translates the syntax to that of Julia's, yielding
a Julia output file. This enables the easy conversion of Python facilities to Julia
and provides an opportunity for those interested in Julia to easily test its
capabilities using previously-written Python code.
